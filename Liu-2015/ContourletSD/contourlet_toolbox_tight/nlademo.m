function nlademo( im, option )
% NLADEMO   Demo for contourlet nonlinear approximation. 
%   NLADEMO shows how to use the contourlet toolbox to do nonlinear 
%   approximation. It provides a sample script that uses basic functions 
%   such as pdfbdec, pdfbrec, showpdfb, pdfb_tr, pdfb2vec and vec2pdfb.
%
%   It can be modified for applications such as denoising, compression, 
%   and computer vision.
%
%   While displaying images, the program will pause and wait for your response.
%   When you are ready, you can just press Enter key to continue.

%       nlademo( [im, option] )
%
% Input:
%	im:     a double or integer matrix for the input image.
%           The default input is the 'peppers' image.  
%   option: option for the demos. The default value is 'auto'
%       'auto' ------  automtatical demo, no input
%       'user' ------  semi-automatic demo, simple interactive inputs
%       'expert' ----  mannual, complete interactive inputs. 
%                      (It is same as 'user' in this version)
