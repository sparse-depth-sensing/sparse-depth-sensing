NOTE: Not all of these changes are included in the current release 
version of the contourlet toolbox.


% April 2002
Developed version 1.0 

by M. N. Do


% 09 Sep, 2003
1. Modified pdfbdec.m and pdfbrec.m so that when nlev(end) == 0, 
a 2D wavelet decomposition is called instead of Laplacian Pyramid + DFB.
This elimiates the need for mpdfbdec/rec.

2. Created wfb2dec.m and wfb2rec.m for 2D wavelet decomposition and 
reconstruction.

% 09 Sep, 2003   
1. Added linear phase filter bank with call name 'dvmlp', 

2. Created/Modified functions dfbdec2_l, dfbrec2_l, fbdec2_l, fbrec2_l  
to perform two-band decomposition with fan filters using ladder 
structure.  This version modulates the rows to get the fan, 
which means vertical fan filter is shorter than horizontal one.  

3. Similarly, created/modified functions dfbdec3_l, dfbrec3_l, fbdec3_l, 
fbrec3_l to perform similar tasks.  This version modulates the columns, 
which means vertical fan filter is longer than horizontal one.  

4. Created 'showdfb' to show dfb frequency components obtained with any 
version of dfbdec. 09/16/2003.

5. Created 'halfband' to generate prototype halfband filter to the ladder 
structure using maximally flat Lagrange filters.  

by A. Cunha


% 17 Sep, 2003  
1. Create the new showpdfb function in showpdfb.m.

2. Add the option for the lowpass wavelet decomposition.

3. Add a function computescale in computescales.m, which
will be called by showpdfb.m 

4. Add two scal modes, denoted by 'scaleMode'. It can also
display the most significant coefficients.

5.  Add 'axis image' to control resizing.

6.  Use the two-fold searching method to find the background
color index.

7. Create demo files (contourletdemo, decdemo, nlademo)

by J. Zhou


% 7 Nov, 2003
1. Simplified pdfbdec.m and pdfbrec.m by adding lpdec.m and lprec.m functions
for Laplacian pyramid decompostion and reconstruction.

2. Simplified fbdec_l, and fbrec_l by computing the path types of the
decomposition/recontruction trees directly rather than recursively updating
them.

3. Update documentation and demo files.

by M. N. Do


% 12 Nov, 2003
1. Fixed a bug that is related to the transform for rectangular matrices 
in functions pdfb2vec and vec2pdfb
